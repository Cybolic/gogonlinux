Gog On Linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This project is a collection of two scripts (and some python libraries)
and its goal is to provide an easy to use platform to play gog 
(http://www.gog.com) games on a GNU/Linux system. 

Each supported game will be installed using a series of patches provided by
http://www.gogonlinux.com team and will be tested and stable to run on most
Linux distributions.

gog-tux is the GUI client that will be installed, it can be used to log onto
a gog.com account and download/install/launch/uninstall the desired gog games.

gog-installer is a cli implementation that can be used to install, setup and
uninstall gog.com games.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

	To install the desired version of the gogonlinux project, untar the 
source package (.tar.gz) and execute "python setup.py install" as root. This 
will setup the required python libraries and install gog-tux and gog-installer
