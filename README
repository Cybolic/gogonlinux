Gog On Linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This project is a collection of two scripts (and some python libraries)
and its goal is to provide an easy to use platform to play gog 
(http://www.gog.com) games on a GNU/Linux system. 

Each supported game will be installed using a series of patches provided by
http://www.gogonlinux.com team and will be tested and stable to run on most
Linux distributions.

gog-tux is the GUI client that will be installed, it can be used to log onto
a gog.com account and download/install/launch/uninstall the desired gog games.

gog-installer is a cli implementation that can be used to install, setup and
uninstall gog.com games.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

	To install the desired version of the gogonlinux project, untar the 
source package (.tar.gz) and execute "python setup.py install" as root. This 
will setup the required python libraries and install gog-tux and gog-installer
on your machine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRED LIBRARIES:

To run this software the following python libraries are required:

- glade2
- oauth2 (notice the 2, it's important)
- requests
- certifi

The best way to install them is using the pip program, it handles dependencies
of python libraries and installs them for you directly.
Using a specific distro's package manager sometimes can result in broken
libraries that may make the software run differently than intended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRED EXTERNAL SOFTWARE:

Without the following programs installed on your system you won't be able to 
install and run the games, so please install them before you run the gog client.

- wine (http://www.winehq.org/) is required to run windows (.exe) gog.com games
- winetricks is a wine script required to setup some wine games
- scummvm (http://www.scummvm.org/) is required for some old adventure games
- dosbox (http://www.dosbox.com/) is required for most old dos videogames
- innoextract (http://constexpr.org/innoextract/) is required to extract and
	setup the .exe installers downloaded from gog.com
- zenity is required for some installation and launcher scripts for games

For an ease of use, please download the aforementioned programs from your 
distribution's package manager (i.e. apt-get for ubuntu).
